I am a big header!
==================
I am a smaller header
---------------------
### This is an even smaller header
This is just a normal paragraph about the quick brown fox jumping over the lazy dog.

*I am an emphasized sentence*

**I am a strong sentence**


> This is a block quote

> It has multiple lines

> It wouldn't be very blocky with just one line

And now for a list!

+ List 1
+ List 2
+ List 3

But wait, there's more!  A list with numbers!

1. Number one
2. Number two
3. Number three

And last but not least, [this is a link](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) to a guide to Markdown basics
